# Assignment-3-python-challenge
Module challenge 3 for week 3, about python

The challenge is focused on creating a script which reads the two csv files: budget data & election vote
The script have various code that follows the module 3 tasks.
Overall, the script successfully runs all of them except for one which is finding the average change. I wasn't able to figure out the formula as it doesn't give me the right one.
Therefore, I'd focused on the rest of challenge and left that one last. Unfortunately I wasn't able to solve it.

In the repository, there are two folders & .py
- Resource - folder where it holds the csv
- Analysis - folder where the code exports the text file
- main.py - the code that runs the system

Overall, the task was a massive challenge
